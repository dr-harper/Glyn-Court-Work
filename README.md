# Glyn Court Work

My Grandfather, Glyn Court, has spent a lifetime writing up history on a range of things. His knowledge never ceases to amaze me, yet much of it is tucked away in boxes and difficult to access.

Last year, I found an old book written by him in 1975 about the family history and local area of Somerset, UK. It was great for me to read and I therefore set myself a challenge to digitise the book, and to get it reprinted in all the glory it deserved.

Going forward, I hope to add to the the list of works that are digitised.
